# React Form
This is just a fancy form made with React and Redux. The form's state is managed by [Redux-Form](https://redux-form.com/7.2.0/). Load animation is done via [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/). Clicking a submit button only console logs the current form values.

## Installation
 1. Clone the repository
 2. Run `npm start` to start the application in the development mode
 3. Run `npm run build` to create a bundle
